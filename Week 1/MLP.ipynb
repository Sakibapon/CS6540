    "1.  **Memory**: 12 billion parameters × 4 bytes × 3 (gradients + optimizer) ≈ **135 GB**. This is impossible for most hardware.\n",
    "2.  **Overfitting**: With only 10,000 training images, having 12 billion parameters means you have ~1.2 million parameters *per example*. The model will just memorize the data instead of learning.\n",
    "3.  **No Spatial Awareness**: MLPs treat adjacent pixels as independent features. They don't understand that pixel (0,0) is next to pixel (0,1). This is a huge waste of information!"

    "### Analysis of the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have all the values in the table above, let's look at the trends:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Parameter Growth**: Notice how the 'Input Pixels' column grows with the square of the resolution, and the 'Parameters' column follows it closely. This is because the first layer (FC1) has a weight for every single pixel. When you go from 28x28 to 256x256, you increase pixels by ~83x, and the parameters jump from 1.8M to 66.5M (~37x increase).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Training Time vs. Accuracy**: \n",
    "    - To get from **86% to 88% accuracy** (a 2% gain), you had to increase your training time from **88 seconds to 733 seconds** (an 8.3x increase).\n",
    "    - You also had to increase your model size from **6.8 MB to 253 MB**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **The Memory Explosion**: Look at the hypothetical **2000x2000** resolution. A simple 3-layer MLP would require **14.90 GB** of RAM just to store the weights. If you include gradients and optimizer states, you would need over **45 GB of VRAM**, which exceeds most consumer GPUs (like the RTX 4090 which has 24GB).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: MLPs are 'spatial-blind'. They don't know that pixels near each other are related. They try to learn every possible combination of every pixel, which leads to this parameter explosion. You need an architecture that understands spatial relationships and shares weights across the image."

    "## 10. The Solution: Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiments above show that MLPs do not scale well. As image size increases linearly, the parameter count (and memory usage) grows quadratically with the image dimension (width * height).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** solve this by:\n",
    "1.  **Local Connectivity**: Neurons only look at small patches of the image.\n",
    "2.  **Parameter Sharing**: The same filter is used across the entire image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, you will implement a CNN and see that it can handle larger images with a fraction of the parameters!"
